Im Veronica. I'm an SF native, lover of design and UX and am always open to chatting about new/different opportunities (or dogs or beer 🙃). I've been circling around the Bay Area for my whole life; SF for childhood, wine country pre college and UC Berkeley for undergrad - go Bears 🐻- , and more recently back in SF working in tech for the last five years. I am passionate about mental health advocacy and rescuing dogs. If you'd like to see more work, please reach out (I have more stuff of varying focuses stashed locally).

This site was built with React, Gatsby, styled-components and alot of linear-gradients (they're still cool, shh).
